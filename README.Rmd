# BirdNET Performance Comparison

## Overview

This repository provides a comparative analysis of the BirdNET algorithm performance to that of Koogu, 'GibbonNetR', and a traditional ML approach that combines MFCC features with support vector machines. The code provided compares the different algorithms across various datasets and configurations.

## Data availabilty
Data needed to run the analyses can be found on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/12706803.

## Organization


- **Data Processing**: Scripts to preprocess audio files and prepare them for BirdNET analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Tools to evaluate BirdNET's performance on different datasets.
- **Visualization**: Scripts to generate plots and charts that visualize BirdNET's accuracy and other performance metrics.
- **Comparison Metrics**: Calculation of precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.
