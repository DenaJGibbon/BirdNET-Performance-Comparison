# BirdNET Performance Comparison

## Overview

This repository provides a comparative analysis of the BirdNET algorithm performance to that of Koogu, 'GibbonNetR', and a traditional ML approach that combines MFCC features with support vector machines. The code provided compares the different algorithms across various datasets and configurations.

## Data availabilty
Data needed to run the analyses can be found on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/12706803.

## Organization (in th R folder)

- **data_processing**: Scripts to preprocess audio files and prepare them for BirdNET analysis.
- **models**: Contains the required scripts to train the models.
- **plots**: Scripts to generate plots for publication.
